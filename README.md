# Damon_Aquire_Analyze
This is a repository for my Acquire and Analyze project

It is focused on looking at the language used in twenty different conservation nonprofit's mission, vision, and values statments as well as their tweets. 

I looked at the most common words used in each as well as different values embedded. The most common words helped me learn about some of the topics the nonprofits focus on in their missions and tweets to see how similar they were. Looking at different values in their missions and tweets let me identify the values the nonprofits portray to their audiences and any differences between their stated missions and their communication to the public via tweets.
